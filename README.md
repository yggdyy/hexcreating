# HexCreating
An addon on fabric for both Create and Hexcasting.  
Now in development.  
  
# ~~Grumble~~
This repo actually firstly come from the https://github.com/miyucomics/hexcellular, i copied it to get a stable develop environment, and then had its code all deleted (at least i think so). So you may found some files from the hexcellular.  
Sincerely thank miyucomics for his great work (getting hexcasting as dependence is really difficult).
