  "hexcreating.page.liquid_media.0": "From what I understand, media comes in myriad forms. The most common are the ordinary solid state (some call it crystalline), the semi-liquid form in reagent bottles, and what I'll discuss next - pure liquid.$(br)However, this liquid media seems rather impractical. It neither directly fuels spellcasting nor is as portable as reagent bottles or solid amethyst clusters.",
  "hexcreating.page.liquid_media.1": "Mixing amethyst shards with water in a basin, then vigorously stirring with kinetic mechanisms, produces a purple liquid - the liquid media. This process also works with amethyst fragments or charged amethyst, though it requires... let's say... assistance from the Nether's fiery denizens.",
  "hexcreating.page.liquid_media.2": "Beyond solid-to-liquid conversion, semi-liquid media in reagent bottles can be separated through a fluid splitter, while liquid media can fill bottles via injectors. Note: 1mB liquid media ≈ 1 amethyst shard.$(br)Regrettably, no efficient method exists to reverse this process back to solid form.",
  "hexcreating.page.liquid_media.3": "These are my current findings, but research continues. Perhaps mass storage using hose pulleys from engineers? Though sourcing enough media and constructing containment remain challenges. I suspect connections between liquid media and that skull-like spell pattern...",

  "hexcreating.page.liquid_soul.1": "Typically, souls dissipate upon death. Yet I observed Soul Sand/Soil's eternal flames briefly retain them.$(br)When creatures perish in soul fire, they drop Raw Soul - usually 1, sometimes 2. This likely relates to the swirling soul sand particles.",
  "hexcreating.page.liquid_soul.2": "Heating 25mB liquid media with 1 Raw Soul yields 25mB Liquid Soul.$(br)Souls from same species blend seamlessly - individual differences erased.$(br)Impossible to contain in buckets/bottles, showing how fragile disembodied souls remain, even suspended in media.",

How does this work without individuality?$(br)100mB Villager Liquid Soul → Random functional Impetus. 10mB Allay Liquid Soul → Quenched Allay.
